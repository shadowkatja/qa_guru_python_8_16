# Homework for QA GURU Python lesson 16

Task:

- Implement an automated test for github.com that navigates to the page, finds the Sign In button, and clicks on it (no authentication required).
- Parameterize the test with different browser window sizes (note that the mobile version of the website will require a different test due to changes in the locator structure).
- Provide two options for skipping inappropriate parameters and tests.
- Skip the mobile test if the aspect ratio is for desktop (and vice versa).
- Override the parameter using "indirect".
- Create separate fixtures for each test.
